            <p class="small">
                TripAgvisor is a web application that allows users studying abroad to share their experiences and tips with other
                students. 
                It is built using Ruby on Rails for the full-stack web application and was originally a legacy project that my team redesgined which gave 
                me valuable experience in working with legacy code.
                It was used by Texas A&M students studying abroad in Singapore during the Winter 2022 semester and the client feedback from
                was heavily utilized as this application was develoed using the Agile methodology.

            <h2> Beeline </h2>
            <p class="small">
                Beeline allows a airline passenger to input their current flight path and searches for alternative routes that lead to the same destination in the event of a cancellation or missed flight. The routes are optimized to minimize cost and travel time and allows the user flexibility to pick what flight best suits their needs.
                The application was built with the Remix JavaScript framework for the front end and a Python back-end that interfaces using requests to a hosted server. The server returns shortest paths of mock flight data provided to us by the American Airlines FlightEngine open-source tool. The Python back-end runs graph algorithms to find the optimal path between airports accounting for travel time and price.

            <h2> Isomorpher </h2>
            <p class="small"> Isomorpher was a project created for my undergraduate research assistant position in the
                Aggie Research Program. The research was on graph mining with the open
                source engine Peregrine. The objective was to find which isomorphic variant of a pattern would perform
                the best when mining a large social media graph and analyze what causes the differences in performace.
                It is written in C++ and allows you enter an input graph it will exhuastively generate all isomorphic
                variants of the pattern.
                It writes each variant in a seperate output file in the current directory and can addtionally generate
                LaTeX
                source code that displays each of the variants.

            <p class="small">
                Point of Sales System was a group project in which we designed a point of sales system for a local buisnesses to track
                sales
                and manage invetory. It provided the resturant servers
                with an interface to select menu items and place orders, and provided the manager with an interface to
                track
                inventory, add menu items, and view sale reports data.
                The front-end was written in Java while the database was created using PostgreSQL and hosted on AWS.

            <h2> Harmonia </h2>
            <p class="small"> Harmonia was created with team during HowdyHack 2021; a hackathon hosted by the
                organization
                TAMUHack at Texas A&M. All brainstorming, planning, coding,
                and testing was done withingin a 24 hour period. Because of this, we delegated functions among our team
                and
                incorporated code from each member into final product.
                It was written entirely in Python and utilized Tkinter for a graphical user interface to display virtual
                piano keyboard.
                Additionally it used the playsound module to allow user to learn about triads and harmonies through
                auditory
                juxtaposition.

            <h2> Global Study Set </h2>
            <p class="small"> Global Study Set is a Java project that generates digital flashcards that automatically
                contains the same word in different languages.
                It allows user to study cards, take quizzes on them, and add their favorites to a collection to study
                later.
                It was heavily designed in object-oriented structure with advanced use of Java containers, generics, and
                bounded types.
                It utilizes a comma seperated text file containing parallel translation data to support five languages.
