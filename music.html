        <h2> Restart </h2>
        <p> 
            I produced this piece in 2022 to represent the calm and contentment that comes from accepting negative experiences 
            and moving forward with your life without need the need to justify them.

        <h2> Empty Desires </h2>
        <p> 
            This is the longest and most ambitious track I've made and it was worked on in fragments throughout the summer of 2019. 
            This fragmentation is noticeable as it transitions through very distinct sections that evoke different emotions. 
            This was  the first piece I made without incorporating any instrument samples and marked my transition to synthesizers and electronic sounds.

        <h2> Oasis </h2>
        <p> 
            This song was written towards the end of 2019 during an optimistic afterglow that followed a somber summer.
            I originally envisioned this as a background track for someone to record lyrics on top, which is why it doesn't feature any prominent melodies.

        <h2> Uncharted Horizon </h2>
        <p> 
            I produced this during the spring break of 2020 when there were a lot of changes happening in my life that were altering my self-perception.
            The synths create an atomosphere that emulates the sense of mystery and excitement that comes with going into the unknown. 
            Interestingly, this happened right before the lockdown from the COVID-19 pandemic, so my intuition of unexplored territory now means something else in retrospect.
