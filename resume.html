        <h3> Skills and Interests </h3>
        <p class="spaced"> I am the most comfortable in the language C++ due to my academic exposure to it but practice
            competitive coding in Python and have a strong Java foundation. I recently learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as evident by
            this website which was designed using those.
            I am also well-versed in the functional language Haskell and basic scripting in BASH. Outside of coding,
            I am proficient in Microsoft Office products including Word, Excel, and Powerpoint. I am also skilled at writing professional documents
            in LaTeX. 
        </p>
        <p class="spaced">
            I find interest in many topics in the world of technology but tend to pay attention the most to news in machine learning. In the future, I wish to work on a project that involves training a model to compose music based on a reference track that defines the intended atmosphere. 
            A possible application of this project would be for game developers to procedurally generate music for in-game locations so that each player can have a unique experience every time they play.
            Designing this would unite my passions in coding, music, and game design.
